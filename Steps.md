TypeGORM - Remaining Development Steps
Here's a roadmap outlining the major tasks remaining to complete TypeGORM based on the initial requirements and current progress:

Phase 2 – Implement Remaining Database Drivers

While MySQL is functional, supporting the other target databases is crucial for the ORM's versatility.

2.1 SQLite Driver (pkg/dialects/sqlite):

Implement common.Dialect interface (quoting, bind vars ?, data type mapping - INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, TEXT, etc.).

Implement common.DataSource using a suitable Go driver (e.g., mattn/go-sqlite3).

Add integration tests specific to SQLite nuances.

2.2 PostgreSQL Driver (pkg/dialects/postgres):

Implement common.Dialect (quoting ", bind vars $1, $2, data types - SERIAL, VARCHAR, TIMESTAMPTZ, etc.).

Implement common.DataSource using a driver (e.g., jackc/pgx/v5).

Handle PostgreSQL-specific features if needed (e.g., RETURNING clause for Create).

Add integration tests.

2.3 SQL Server Driver (pkg/dialects/sqlserver):

Implement common.Dialect (quoting [], bind vars @p1, data types - INT IDENTITY, NVARCHAR, DATETIME2, etc.).

Implement common.DataSource using a driver (e.g., microsoft/go-mssqldb).

Add integration tests.

2.4 Oracle Driver (pkg/dialects/oracle):

Implement common.Dialect (quoting ", bind vars :1, data types - NUMBER, VARCHAR2, DATE/TIMESTAMP, sequences/triggers for auto-increment).

Implement common.DataSource using a driver (e.g., sijms/go-ora or potentially one requiring CGO/Oracle Instant Client). This might be the most complex driver.

Add integration tests.

2.5 MongoDB Driver (pkg/dialects/mongodb):

Implement common.Dialect (No SQL-specific methods needed, focus on adapting ORM operations).

Implement common.DataSource using the official mongo-driver. This will involve translating ORM operations (Create, Find, Updates, Delete) into MongoDB commands (BSON documents, InsertOne, Find, UpdateOne, DeleteOne).

Adapt schema parsing for NoSQL concepts (collections, _id, potentially embedding).

Add integration tests.

2.6 Redis Driver (pkg/dialects/redis):

Determine the scope: Is it for caching, simple object storage, or specific Redis commands?

Implement common.DataSource (potentially a simplified version) using a driver (e.g., redis/go-redis).

Map ORM operations (e.g., FindByID -> GET, Create -> SET, Delete -> DEL) for simple key-value use cases.

Add integration tests.

Phase 3 – Complete Core ORM Functionalities

Enhance the DB handle with more advanced features.

3.1 Transaction Support:

Define a Tx struct within pkg/typegorm that wraps common.Tx.

Implement DB.Begin(ctx) (*Tx, error).

Implement Tx.Commit() and Tx.Rollback().

Modify/add methods like Tx.Create, Tx.Updates, Tx.Delete, Tx.Find, Tx.FindFirst to operate within the transaction context.

Add integration tests for transactional operations (commit success, rollback on error).

3.2 Advanced Querying (Find, FindFirst Enhancements):

Support more complex conditions beyond simple equality (e.g., IN, LIKE, >, <, BETWEEN, IS NULL). This might require evolving the buildWhereClause helper or introducing a basic query builder object.

Implement OrderBy(clause string) method (or option).

Implement Limit(limit int) method (or option).

Implement Offset(offset int) method (or option).

Add tests for these querying features.

3.3 Update Enhancements:

Implement DB.Update (or enhance Updates) to accept a struct pointer and update based on non-zero/non-nil fields (a common pattern).

Consider adding UpdateColumn(s) methods for explicitly updating only certain columns, ignoring others.

3.4 Relationship Support (Major Task):

Define relationship tags (oneToOne, oneToMany, manyToOne, manyToMany, joinColumn, joinTable, etc.).

Enhance schema.Parser to understand these tags and populate relationship metadata in schema.Model.

Implement Preload(association string) method for eager loading related data.

Implement logic for handling foreign keys during Create, Update, Delete.

(Advanced) Implement Joins(association string) for manual joins in queries.

Add extensive tests for all relationship types and preloading.

3.5 Hooks/Callbacks:

Define hook interfaces (e.g., BeforeCreate(db *DB), AfterFind(db *DB)).

Modify schema.Parser to detect methods implementing these interfaces on models.

Modify core ORM methods (Create, Updates, Delete, Find*) to call these hooks at appropriate points.

Add tests for hooks.

3.6 Complete Migration Logic (pkg/migration):

Implement the actual database interaction logic inside RunUp and RunDown using the DataSource and Dialect methods (connecting, ensuring table, reading files, parsing SQL, executing in transaction, updating history table).

Add support for .go migration files (defining Up/Down functions).

Thoroughly test the migration runner against different database states.

3.7 Schema Parser Enhancements:

Implement support for embedded structs.

Refine handling of sql.Null* types.

Add more validation during parsing.

3.8 Performance & Optimization:

Implement statement caching/prepared statements where beneficial.

Analyze query performance and potential optimizations.

Consider adding optional result caching (e.g., using the Redis driver).

Phase 4 – Documentation, Examples, and Publication

Prepare the project for public consumption.

4.1 Comprehensive Documentation (/docs):

Write detailed guides for installation, configuration, defining models, CRUD operations, querying, migrations, relationships, hooks, transactions, etc.

Provide clear API documentation (can leverage GoDoc comments).

Document how to add support for new dialects.

4.2 Examples (/examples):

Create small, runnable example projects for each supported database, demonstrating common use cases.

4.3 Refine README.md:

Update with project status, features, quick start guide, links to docs/examples.

4.4 Testing & CI/CD:

Ensure high test coverage (unit and integration).

Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing (including integration tests with Docker services), linting (golangci-lint), and building on pushes/PRs.

4.5 Release Strategy:

Use Git tags for versioning (SemVer).

Publish official releases on GitHub.

Ensure it's easily installable via go get.

4.6 Community:

Define contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md).

Set up issue templates.

Consider a code of conduct.

This list covers the major areas needed to bring TypeGORM to a functional and publishable state. It's a significant amount of work, so prioritizing based on core ORM features (like Transactions, more Querying, Relationships) is usually a good approach.
